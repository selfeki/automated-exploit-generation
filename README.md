This is an implementation of an ACM research paper published by cybersecurity researchers at Carnegie Mellon University: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2560217.2560219
The implementation leverages modern binary analysis tooling (angr.io) which was not available at the time the paper was published.
